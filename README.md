# Portfolio Project

This portfolio project showcases my skills and projects as a web developer. It is designed to provide an overview of my work, experience, and abilities in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The portfolio includes a home page that introduces me and summarizes my skills and experience, an about page that provides detailed information about my background and interests, a projects page that showcases my various projects with descriptions, images, and links to live projects or repositories, and a contact page that includes a form for visitors to reach out to me directly. The project leverages HTML for the structure and content of the web pages, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactive elements and functionality.
